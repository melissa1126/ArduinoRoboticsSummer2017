I copy the coding from the reference and plug the Arduino according to the image on the reference  
Then add  Serial.begin(9600); under setup
Serial.println(sensorValue); under loop

then random number appears 
the range of these number is between 200 and 400
there is no big differences between cover and uncover the LDR
cover blink fast and the number is lower
